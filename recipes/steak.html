  <h1>Bistro-Style Steak</h1>
  <p>A semla is a delicious Swedish cardamom-scented, buttery bun filled with sweet almond paste and fluffy whipped cream. Semlor buns are traditionally eaten the day before the start of Lent, but they are so enjoyable that I suggest you make them anytime!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (14-ounce) New York strip steak</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon melted clarified butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons minced shallots</li>
    <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>
    <li>1/3 cup beef bone broth</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Trim any excess fat from the steak, then trim off the tough membrane by running a sharp knife between the membrane and the meat under the fat cap of the steak. Season evenly on both sides with salt and pepper, and place on a crinkled-up piece of foil set on a plate.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 2 and up to 10 hours, turning occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring the steak out of the refrigerator to sit at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before beginning to cook, turning over once halfway through.</li>
    <li>Place a heavy duty steel pan over high heat, and add oil and clarified butter. When the fats are hot and start to shimmer, place steak in the pan. When steak begins to sizzle, reduce the heat to medium.</li>
    <li>Cook the first side for 2 minutes, then pick up the steak with tongs, and rub the seared surface around the pan to redistribute the fat under the steak. Sear the first side for 2 minutes more, for a total of 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn steak over and repeat searing on the second side, 4 minutes total, or until the steak is cooked to your desired doneness. For medium rare, remove steak when an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center reaches 125 degrees F (52 degrees C). Turn off the heat, remove the steak to a plate, cover very loosely with foil, and let rest while you make the pan sauce, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>For sauce, add minced shallots to the still-hot pan, and cook, stirring, until they start to soften and take on some color, about 1 minute. If there is not enough residual heat in the pan for this step, turn heat back on to medium.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat to high, and add wine. Cook, stirring, until wine reduces by at least half, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the beef bone broth, and cook until the liquids in the pan reduce by about 3/4, 1 to 2 minutes more. Turn off heat.</li>
    <li>Add cold butter cubes, and swirl the pan until butter disappears and a slightly thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 30 seconds. Season with a pinch of salt if needed, and serve over rested steak.</li>
  </ol>
